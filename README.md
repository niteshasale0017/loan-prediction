# loan-prediction

### data cleaning and checking the missing vlaues
### now lets the drop all missing values remaining
### Exploratory Data Analysis.
### compparism between parameter in getting the Loan
### lets the replace the Variable value to numerical form and display the value counts
### the data in numerical form avoid disturbances in building the model.
### from the above figure, we can see that Credit History (Dependent Variables) has the maximum correlation with
### loan Status (Dependent Variable). which denote that the loan_satus is heavily dependent on the credit history
### logistic regression is supervised leaning classification algorithm ussed to predict the probability of the target variable
### Mathematicaly a logistic regression model predict p(y=1) as a function of x. it is the one of simplest ML Algorithm that 
### can be used various classification problem such as a spam detection,Diabetes Prediction, Cancer Dection, Loan Prediction etc.
